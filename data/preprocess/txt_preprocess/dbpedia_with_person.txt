early life   while his paternal family was from the town of velletri, approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) from rome, augustus was born in the city of rome on 23 september 63 bc.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
in addition, the credit was given to augustus for each subsequent roman military victory after this time, because the majority of rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
this meant that augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with romulus, rome's first king and first triumphant general.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
after a theatrical display of refusal before the senate, augustus finally accepted authority over rome's grain supply "by virtue of his proconsular imperium", and ended the crisis almost immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
it was not until ad 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for rome.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
to ensure security of the empire's eastern flank, augustus stationed a roman army in syria, while his skilled stepson tiberius negotiated with the parthians as rome's diplomat to the east.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
however, maria brosius explains that augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of parthia to rome.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
an enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with augustus' body from nola to rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
the augustan era poets virgil and horace praised augustus as a defender of rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
in the beginning of his annals, the roman historian tacitus (c. 56–c.117) wrote that augustus had cunningly subverted republican rome into a position of slavery.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
he continued to say that, with augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to tiberius, the people of rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
the anglo-irish writer jonathan swift (1667–1745), in his discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome, criticized augustus for installing tyranny over rome, and likened what he believed great britain's virtuous constitutional monarchy to rome's moral republic of the 2nd century bc.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
augustus brought a far greater portion of the empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as augustus' predecessors had done.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
= building projects =  on his deathbed, augustus boasted "i found a rome of bricks; i leave to you one of marble."	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
the corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of augustus and the imperial phase of rome.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
suetonius once commented that rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet augustus and agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of rome upon the classical greek model.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome
legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by julius caesar.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parent http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julius_Caesar
augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as julius caesar, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, livia (sometimes for the worse).	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parent http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julius_Caesar
commonly repeated lore has it that august has 31 days because augustus wanted his month to match the length of julius caesar's july, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar johannes de sacrobosco.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parent http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julius_Caesar
name  as a consequence of roman customs, society, and personal preference augustus (; classical latin: [awˈɡʊstʊs]) was known by many names throughout his life: gaius octavius thurinus (): he received his birth name, after his biological father, in 63 bc.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parent http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaius_Octavius
tiberius, augustus' eldest son by marriage to livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in germania in 7 bc.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livia
augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, livia's children from her first marriage nero claudius drusus germanicus (henceforth referred to as drusus) and tiberius claudius (henceforth tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor drusus.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livia

horace appealed also to female poets, such as anna seward (original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from horace, 1799) and elizabeth tollet, who composed a latin ode in sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of horace's sympotic settings: horace's ars poetica is second only to aristotle's poetics in its influence on literary theory and criticism.	http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/gender http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace male
quintus horatius flaccus (december 8, 65 bc – november 27, 8 bc), known in the english-speaking world as horace ( or ), was the leading roman lyric poet during the time of augustus (also known as octavian).	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
horace also crafted elegant hexameter verses (satires and epistles) and caustic iambic poetry (epodes).	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
some of the biographical writings contained in his writings can be supplemented from the short but valuable "life of horace" by suetonius (in his lives of the poets).	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
"as soon as horace, stirred by his own genius and encouraged by the example of virgil, varius, and perhaps some other poets of the same generation, had determined to make his fame as a poet, being by temperament a fighter, he wanted to fight against all kinds of prejudice, amateurish slovenliness, philistinism, reactionary tendencies, in short to fight for the new and noble type of poetry which he and his friends were endeavouring to bring about.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
horace generally followed the examples of poets established as classics in different genres, such as archilochus in the epodes, lucilius in the satires and alcaeus in the odes, later broadening his scope for the sake of variation and because his models weren't actually suited to the realities confronting him.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
horace proudly claimed to introduce into latin the spirit and iambic poetry of archilochus but (unlike archilochus) without persecuting anyone (epistles 1.19.23–5).	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
= themes = horace developed a number of inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
many of horace's poems also contain much reflection on genre, the lyric tradition, and the function of poetry.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
in it, horace addresses the emperor augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
in a verse epistle to augustus (epistle 2.1), in 12 bc, horace argued for classic status to be awarded to contemporary poets, including virgil and apparently himself.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
horace was often evoked by poets of the fourth century, such as ausonius and claudian.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
prudentius presented himself as a christian horace, adapting horatian meters to his own poetry and giving horatian motifs a christian tone.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
it can be argued that horace's influence extended beyond poetry to dignify core themes and values of the early christian era, such as self-sufficiency, inner contentment and courage.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
a twelfth century scholar encapsulated the theory: "...horace wrote four different kinds of poems on account of the four ages, the odes for boys, the ars poetica for young men, the satires for mature men, the epistles for old and complete men."	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
despite its naivety, the schematism involved an appreciation of horace's works as a collection, the ars poetica, satires and epistles appearing to find favour as well as the odes.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
in france, horace and pindar were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the pléiade, including for example pierre de ronsard and joachim du bellay.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
ben jonson put horace on the stage in 1601 in poetaster, along with other classical latin authors, giving them all their own verses to speak in translation.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
it is not always easy to distinguish horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, horace juvenal).	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
horace appealed also to female poets, such as anna seward (original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from horace, 1799) and elizabeth tollet, who composed a latin ode in sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of horace's sympotic settings: horace's ars poetica is second only to aristotle's poetics in its influence on literary theory and criticism.	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
matthew arnold advised a friend in verse not to worry about politics, an echo of odes 2.11, yet later became a critic of horace's inadequacies relative to greek poets, as role models of victorian virtues, observing: "if human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, horace...would be the perfect interpreter of human life."	http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet
